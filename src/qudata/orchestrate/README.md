# ETL Orchestration and Workflow Management

The orchestrate module provides comprehensive workflow orchestration capabilities for managing complex data processing pipelines.

## Components

### WorkflowOrchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
- Apache Airflow and Prefect integration
- Workflow definition and execution management
- Task dependency resolution and scheduling
- Distributed execution support

### TaskScheduler (`scheduler.py`)
- Cron-based scheduling for periodic tasks
- Event-driven task triggering
- Priority-based task queuing
- Resource-aware scheduling

### PipelineRunner (`runner.py`)
- End-to-end pipeline execution
- Stage-by-stage processing with checkpoints
- Progress tracking and status reporting
- Parallel and sequential execution modes

### DependencyManager (`dependencies.py`)
- Task dependency graph construction
- Circular dependency detection
- Dependency resolution algorithms
- Dynamic dependency updates

### RetryManager (`retry.py`)
- Configurable retry policies
- Exponential backoff strategies
- Failed task recovery mechanisms
- Error classification and handling

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Workflow
```python
from qudata.orchestrate import WorkflowOrchestrator, Workflow, Task

orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()

# Define tasks
ingest_task = Task(
    id="ingest",
    function="qudata.ingest.process_files",
    params={"input_dir": "/data/raw"}
)

clean_task = Task(
    id="clean",
    function="qudata.clean.clean_documents",
    depends_on=["ingest"]
)

# Create workflow
workflow = Workflow(
    id="data_processing",
    tasks=[ingest_task, clean_task]
)

# Execute
result = orchestrator.execute_workflow(workflow)
```

### Scheduling Tasks
```python
from qudata.orchestrate import TaskScheduler, Schedule

scheduler = TaskScheduler()

# Schedule daily processing
schedule = Schedule(
    cron="0 2 * * *",  # Daily at 2 AM
    timezone="UTC"
)

scheduler.schedule_workflow(workflow, schedule)
```

### Running Pipelines
```python
from qudata.orchestrate import PipelineRunner
from qudata.config import load_config

config = load_config("pipeline.yaml")
runner = PipelineRunner(config)

result = runner.run_pipeline(
    input_path="/data/raw",
    output_path="/data/processed"
)
```

## Configuration

Orchestration can be configured through YAML:

```yaml
orchestration:
  executor: "airflow"  # or "prefect", "local"
  max_workers: 4
  retry_policy:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_factor: 2
    max_delay: 300
  scheduling:
    timezone: "UTC"
    max_concurrent_workflows: 10
```

## Integration with External Systems

### Apache Airflow
```python
from qudata.orchestrate import WorkflowOrchestrator

orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(backend="airflow")
orchestrator.deploy_to_airflow(workflow, dag_id="qudata_pipeline")
```

### Prefect
```python
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(backend="prefect")
orchestrator.register_flow(workflow, project="qudata")
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- Real-time execution status tracking
- Detailed task execution logs
- Performance metrics collection
- Error reporting and alerting
- Workflow visualization and debugging

## Error Handling

- Automatic retry with configurable policies
- Graceful failure handling and recovery
- Checkpoint-based resumption
- Dead letter queues for failed tasks
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
